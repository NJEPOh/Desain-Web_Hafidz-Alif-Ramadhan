    <h1>Profil PTIK FKIP UNS</h1>

    <p id="teks">
        PTIK FKIP UNS <br><br>
        The Faculty of Teacher Training and Education, Sebelas Maret University, Surakarta
        is an Educational Personnel Education Institution (LPTK) which has 24 study programs in 6 majors.
        Each study program has its own characteristics in producing superior, strong and intelligent educational staff.
        <br><br>
        The Informatics and Computer Technology Education (PTIK) study program is planned to take shelter in the
        management of the Engineering and Vocational Education (PTK) department. This placement revises our previous
        statement, where the PTIK study program is under the P.MIPA department. PTIK is a study program that will
        produce
        graduates who are prioritized to teach in vocational/vocational programs. So, it would be better if PTIK was
        under
        the PTK department which oversees vocational programs such as Building Engineering Education, and Mechanical
        Engineering Education. To meet the needs of lecturers in the field of information technology that cannot be met
        by
        the PTK department, PTIK will conduct resource sharing with the mathematics study program.
